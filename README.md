Set Spike

An Accessibility Local Multiplayer Game

Created by Hank Davidson, Kate Hillyard and Drew Fethke

What is a set spike? Set spike is a Beach Volleyball game with the focus on exciting and dynamic fun that keeps players engaged and laughing the whole time!  With accessibility in mind, the team is designing an intricate accessibility controller to support players born with Phocomelia syndrome; a rare congenital birth defect characterized by the absence or severe shortening of limbs. First, we were introduced to Amira Speed, while a persona in our scenario, She is a Social Media manager and a disability rights advocate! She enjoys platformers, party games and chaotic multiplayer gamers where laughter is guaranteed. That is our team's shared vision! With her preferences in mind, we created a game that mimics games like Super Mario, Mario Party, and Wii Sports! Our game combines these games into a fun and unforgettable experience.
